# Release

**June. 2024 - Update the point cloud of the small city extracted from RGB-depth pairs using [rgbd2pc.py](scripts/rgbd2pc.py), which can be used as the initialization of [3DGS](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/).**

**Apr. 2024 - Update the script for extracting point clouds from several rgb-depth pairs at [rgbd2pc.py](scripts/rgbd2pc.py), which can be used as the initialization of [3DGS](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/).**

**Apr. 2024 - Release depth maps of aerial data in float32 format on Hugging Face and Baidu Netdisk. Update the scripts for loading depth and normal maps.**
- We recommand that using the depth maps in float32 format for aerial views because the default for EXR is float16, which can represent up to 65504cm and does not effectively represent the depth for aerial views.
- Add checks for invalid masks in the scripts including the sky and content exceeding the maximum depth range.

**Feb. 2024 - Release diffuse, metallic, roughness and specular of Small City on Hugging Face and Baidu Netdisk**

**Jan. 2024 - Release depth maps of Big City**

**Dec. 2023 - V1.0.1 MatrixCityPlugin Released**
- Documentation on using our plugins to collect custom data. 
- Render configs and sequences used in our paper.
- Related useful scripts.

**Oct. 2023 - Attend ICCV 2023 Conference.**

**Sep. 2023 - MatrixCity Dataset Released.**

# Data Download

We provide three ways to download our MatrixCity dataset.

**Hugging Face**: https://huggingface.co/datasets/BoDai/MatrixCity/tree/main

**Openxlab**: https://openxlab.org.cn/datasets/bdaibdai/MatrixCity

**Baidu Netdisk**: https://pan.baidu.com/s/187P0e5p1hz9t5mgdJXjL1g#list/path=%2F (password: hqnn)


# Data Color Space

We output depth and normal maps in EXR format, while RGB, diffuse, specular, roughness, and metallic are output in PNG format. All files in EXR format are in linear space, and all images in PNG format are in sRGB space. Please use [gamma correction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_correction) for conversion.

# Depth and Normal Map Note

- Our depth maps are **Z-depth**, which refers to the distance between a point in the 3D space and the camera along the Z-axis, which is aligned with the camera's direction of view. 

- Our depth maps are rendered with anti-aliasing settings to align with RGB images. However, this may result in artifacts when converting depth maps to point clouds, as discussed in the [issue#4](https://github.com/city-super/MatrixCity/issues/4). We provide the guidance to render depth maps without anti-alias in [Render Data/Depth-1](https://github.com/city-super/MatrixCity/blob/main/MatrixCityPlugin/docs/Render-Data.md#depth).
- The depth maps are in EXR format, which defaults to float16 data type with a maximum range of 65504. For depth maps, this means the farthest distance that can be expressed is 65504 cm, so we recommend using the depth maps in float32 format for aerial views. We provide the guidance to export EXR files in float32 format in [Render Data/Depth-2](https://github.com/city-super/MatrixCity/blob/main/MatrixCityPlugin/docs/Render-Data.md#depth). Also we provide code in [load_data.py](scripts/load_data.py) to identify the invalid part of depth maps in float16 precision.
- The normal maps of the sky portion are invalid, and we provide code in [load_data.py](scripts/load_data.py) to identify the invalid masks.


# Export Point Clouds
We provide the point clouds of the small city (both aerial and street views). You can also use [rgbd2pc.py](https://github.com/city-super/MatrixCity/blob/main/scripts/rgbd2pc.py) to extract point clouds from any RGB-depth pairs you have‼️ The generated point clouds can be used as the initialization of [3DGS](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/).

# Pose File Structure

We use the same pose coordinate system as original [NeRF repo](https://github.com/bmild/nerf): the local camera coordinate system of an image is defined in a way that the X axis points to the right, the Y axis upwards, and the Z axis backwards as seen from the image.

- **camera_angle_x**: The fov (field of view) of horizontal direction. The unit is radian but not angle.
- **fl_x**: The focal length of the image. The unit is pixel.
- **fl_y**: This is a copy of fl_x.
- **w**: The width of the image. The unit is pixel.
- **h**: The height of the image. The unit is pixel.
- **frames**:
  - **file_path**: The relative path of the image in the MatrixCity directory structure.
  - **transform_matrix**: Poses are stored as $4 \times 4$ numpy arrays that represent camera-to-world transformation matrices. The last row of the matrix is ​​padding and has no other meaning.

# MatrixCityPlugin
Our plugin is developed based on the v0.1.0 version of [xrfeitoria](https://github.com/openxrlab/xrfeitoria/tree/v0.1.0). Thank [Haiyi Mei](https://haiyi-mei.com/) and [Lei Yang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=jZH2IPYAAAAJ&hl=en) for
their invaluable help and discussions for the plug-in development.
> It leverages [Unreal Engine 5.0.3](https://www.unrealengine.com/) to automatically collect large-scale and high-quality city data from [City Sample project](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/product/city-sample).
>
> Allowing researchers to flexibly control lighting, weather, and transient objects.
>
> Using this to generate synthetic data including rgb, depth, normal map, decomposed BRDF materials etc.
>
> General camera noises like motion blur and defocus blur can be simulated in UE5.
>
> This plugin is relied on the [Movie Render Queue](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/render-cinematics-in-unreal-engine/) plugin, and is python-friendly.
